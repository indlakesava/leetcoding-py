'''
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000

'''
Explanation:
We do this in 3 steps
find the middle by using slow and fast pointers 
sort the second half 
start pointing the first half and second half one node at a time
