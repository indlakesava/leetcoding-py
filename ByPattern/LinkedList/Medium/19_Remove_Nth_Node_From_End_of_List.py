#https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/
'''
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz

Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(head, n):
        slow = fast = dummy = ListNode(-1, head)

        for _ in range(n + 1):
            fast = fast.next

        while fast is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next

        slow.next = slow.next.next if slow.next is not None else None

        return dummy.next

'''
Explanation:
Fist we move n places using fast pointer
Next we move slow and fast by 1 node till fast reaches end
Finally we skip the nth node from last if it's not none
